#  Employee Directory

## Overview

The task is to create a employee directory with React. This assignment requires the application's UI to be broken into components, the component state to be managed, and to respond to user events.

## User Story

* As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

## Business Context

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

## Acceptance Criteria 

The user should be able to:

  * Sort the table by at least one category

  * Filter the users by at least one property.
